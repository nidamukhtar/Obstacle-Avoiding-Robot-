# Obstacle Avoiding Robot
is a project that I built with the help of my classmate 
for our CSE251 course, Electrical Circuit Analysis 
in my sophmore year in Yanbu University College
-----------------------
# In this project, the robot moves in a straight path until 
it detects an object in front of it. 
The detection is done using lever snap switches 
attached to the front. When the robot comes in 
contact with an obstacle, the switches are clicked.
It then avoids the object by changing the direction
of the wheels. Depending on which switch comes into 
contact with the object, it changes its path accordingly.
It may turn to the right, left, or go backwards to 
avoid collision.
